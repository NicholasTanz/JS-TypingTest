Weather patterns are caused by the movement of air masses and changes in temperature and pressure. 
The sun's energy heats the Earth's surface, causing warm air to rise and cool air to sink. This movement 
of air creates winds and pressure systems, which can lead to different types of weather. For example, low pressure systems 
often bring clouds and rain, while high pressure systems bring clear skies and fair weather. The jet stream, a strong wind that 
flows high in the atmosphere, also plays a role in shaping weather patterns. It helps guide weather systems and storm systems across 
the planet. Understanding these patterns can help us predict and prepare for severe weather, such as hurricanes and tornadoes.
