Buddhism is a philosophy and religion that originated in ancient India. Its core teachings revolve around the Four Noble Truths: the truth of suffering, the truth of the cause of suffering, the truth of the cessation of suffering, and the truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering. The ultimate goal of Buddhism is to achieve enlightenment, which is a state of inner peace and liberation from the cycle of rebirth and suffering. The path to enlightenment involves the development of wisdom and ethical conduct, through practices such as meditation and the cultivation of virtues such as compassion and non-attachment. Buddhism also emphasizes the importance of understanding the interdependence of all things and the impermanence of all phenomena.
