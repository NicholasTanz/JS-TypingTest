Circuit analysis is the process of determining the behavior of an electric circuit by solving the system of equations that describe the circuit's elements and their interactions. At a college level, circuit analysis is typically studied in the context of electrical engineering and deals with both direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) circuits.
In DC circuit analysis, Kirchhoff's laws, Ohm's law and circuit theorems such as Thevenin's and Norton's theorem are used to analyze and simplify circuits. In AC circuit analysis, complex numbers are used to represent sinusoidal signals, and phasors are used to represent the magnitudes and phases of these signals. The use of Laplace transforms and frequency-domain analysis methods such as the Fourier series and the Fourier transform allow us to analyze the circuit's response to sinusoidal inputs.
Circuit analysis is an essential tool for the design and analysis of electrical systems and devices, including power systems, electronic circuits, and control systems. With the aid of computer-aided simulation tools such as Pspice.
