Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lucy who loved to explore the forest behind her house. 
One day, while exploring, she came across a small, injured bird. She picked it up and brought it home, 
nursing it back to health. The bird, grateful for her kindness, followed Lucy everywhere she went. They 
became the best of friends and went on many adventures together. One day, the bird had to fly away to migrate with his family, 
but he promised to come back and visit Lucy every year. And true to his word, the bird returned to visit her every year, and their 
friendship continued to grow stronger
