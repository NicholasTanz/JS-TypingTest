Once upon a time, in a land of building blocks, there lived a group of Lego friends. 
They were all different shapes and colors, but they all loved to play together. 
One day, they decided to build a castle. They worked hard, building towers and walls, and decorating it with flags and banners. 
When they were finished, they realized they had forgotten to build a door. Suddenly, a magical Lego fairy appeared and said, "I can help you build a door, but first you must solve a riddle." 
The riddle was "I am not alive, but I grow; I don't have lungs, but I need air; I don't have a mouth, but water kills me. What am I?" 
The friends thought hard and finally figured out the answer was "fire". The fairy was impressed and built them a beautiful castle door. 
From that day on, the friends played in the castle every day, and had lots of fun together.
